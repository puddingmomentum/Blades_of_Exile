  1501, "This makes you more resistant to damage. Blows of all sorts have less of an effect on you."
  1502, "The possessor of this advantage will find that his or her spells will function better. This helps both Priest and Mage spells."
  1503, "An ambidextrous warrior will be able to use one weapon in each hand without any penalties. Normally, using two weapons makes both of them much less likely to hit."
  1504, "Having nimble fingers improves one's chances of picking locks and disarming traps."
  1505, "When underground, knowledge of Cave Lore helps one hunt and forage for food and deal better with special circumstances."
  1506, "When roaming the surface of the world, a Woodsman is able to hunt and bring down food, find useful herbs, and deal with circumstances involving nature's adversity."
  1507, "Someone with a Good Constitution will find that poison and disease have a reduced (although not eliminated) effect."
  1508, "Highly Alert people have the edginess that helps them resist magical sleep. In addition, having someone in your group who is Highly Alert may help keep you from being surprised."
  1509, "An Exceptionally Strong character will be able to carry much more stuff, and, in addition, will do a small amount more damage in combat."
  1510, "A very few adventurers have magical blood running in their veins, causing them to heal damage to their bodies at an amazing rate."
  1511, "Sluggish characters just can't move that quickly, even when circumstances seem to demand it. A sluggish character gets fewer action points in combat."
  1512, "Magically Inept characters, for some reason, resist the effects of magical items, and are unable to use them. Potions and scrolls won't work for them at all, although worn items, such as rings and armor, will have a small effect."
  1513, "Frail characters are cursed at birth with a weak constitution. Poison and disease will have a greater effect on such characters."
  1514, "Chronic Disease is the worst disadvantage a character may possess. Such characters have a slow, lingering, incurable physical ailment, causing them to occasionally suffer the effects of a mild disease."
  1515, "A character with a Bad Back cannot bear to haul too much weight. Such a person cannot carry as much as he or she might have been able to otherwise."
  1516, "Human is the default species in Blades of Exile. Humans have skins of a variety of hues, and are soft, generally fragile, and incredibly resourceful."
  1517, "The Nephilim are a race of feline humanoids. Once common on the surface world, they have been hunted to near extinction, although some now remain in Exile. Nephilim characters start with better dexterity, and are much better at using missile weapons."
  1518, "The Slithzerikai (sliths for short) are a race of lizard men, both strong and smart. Once unknown on the surface world, they are starting to appear there. Slith characters get bonuses to strength and intelligence, and are better at using pole weapons."
  1519, "Blades of Exile Prefs"
  2101, "Light|"

  2104, "Fires a weak bolt of electricity at an enemy."

  2108, "Makes the selected PC more skilled for a short time. Works like the priest spell 'Bless.'"
  2109, "Scare"
  2110, "Decreases the morale of the victim. Casting this on a weak foe will make the foe flee. Even if the monster doesn't flee, later castings have a higher chance of success."

  2119, "True Sight"

  2121, "Minor Poison|"
  2122, "Poisons the target creature. This does a fair amount of damage, but it takes time to happen."
  2123, "Flame"
  2124, "Fires a decent-sized bolt of flame at the target. The damage done increases with the level of the caster."
  2125, "Slow"
  2126, "Makes the victim get half its usual number of actions for a while."
  2127, "Dumbfound"
  2128, "Makes the victim incompetent: easier to hit, easier to damage, and less able to attack you."
  2129, "Envenom |"
  2130, "This spell puts poison on the weapon of the selected PC, with no chance of failure or accidental poisoning."
  2131, "Stinking Cloud"
  2132, "When cast, a 3x3 area you select becomes filled with choking gasses. Anyone entering will have far less effective attacks for a short time. The gas will slowly fade on its own."
  2133, "Summon Beast"
  2134, "This spell summons one low-level, non-magical monster to fight on your side. It disappears after a short time."
  2135, "Conflagration"

  2139, "Sleep Cloud"
  2140, "This spell creates a small cloud of sleep gas. There is a chance that anyone passing through the cloud will fall asleep (note that some creatures, like slimes, never sleep)."
  2141, "Unlock Doors"

  2143, "Haste |"
  2144, "Makes the selected PC get twice the usual number of actions for a long time. All haste spells take effect at the beginning of the next round."
  2145, "Fireball"
  2146, "Fires a powerful ball of flame, which affects the target space and every adjacent space. The damage done increases with the level of the caster."
  2147, "Long Light"
  2148, "Like the first level light spell, but much more effective."
  2149, "Fear"
  2150, "Like scare, but much more powerful. "
  2151, "Wall of Force"
  2152, "This powerful spell creates a line of force walls, which are like fire walls but more damaging and lasting. Hitting the space bar while targeting makes the wall rotate."
  2153, "Weak Summoning"
  2154, "When cast, a group of monsters appears and attacks all enemies of the caster. The number of monsters depends on the level of the caster. After a time, they disappear."
  2155, "Flame Arrows"
  2156, "This spell is like flame, but the caster gets to select several targets. The number of missiles increases with the level of the caster. If you don't want to use all the missiles, hit the space bar to cast the spell."
  2157, "Web"
  2158, "This spell covers a large circle with icky webs, slowing down everyone inside. The webs last until torn down."
  2159, "Resist Magic"
  2160, "You can cast this spell on another PC to make him/her resistant to magical damage and effects. Note this does not help against damage from fire or cold."
  2161, "Poison"
  2162, "This makes poison run thick in the veins of the target. Repeated castings will have a devastating effect."
  2163, "Ice Bolt"
  2164, "Slams the target with a heavy, pointed bolt of ice. Effective against monsters who are resistant to fire. Damage increases as the level of the caster increases."
  2165, "Slow Group"
  2166, "Makes all monsters within a 12 space radius move at half speed for a time."
  2167, "Magic Map"
  2168, "When cast in town, this powerful spell gives you a vision - your map will show you the entire area. However, to cast this spell you need a sapphire."
  2169, "Capture Soul"
  2170, "This spell stores a target monster in your mind, so that it may later be created with the Simulacrum spell."
  2171, "Simulacrum"
  2172, "This spell summons a monster you have memorized using Capture Soul. The cost depends on the level of the monster being summoned."
  2173, "Venom Arrows"
  2174, "This spell is similar to Flame Arrows, except that your targets are poisoned."
  2175, "Wall of Ice"

  3661, "Move Mountains and Dispel Barrier are very useful spells. Haste will save your party from many a nasty fight."
  3662, "Can't cast a mage spell you've learned? Make sure your Mage Spells skill is up to at least the level of the spell. Then make sure you're not dumbfounded (Restore Mind cures this). Then make sure you have enough spell points."

  3903, "Alchemy can be incredibly useful. Potions can give you the added boost you may need to get through a long grueling dungeon, and you cannot raise the dead without the right concoction."
  3904, "You need three things to make a potion:|1. High alchemy skill. When a character tries to make a potion, his/her alchemy skill must be above a certain level. The higher above that level, the better the chance for success."
  3905, "2. The right ingredient. Ingredients are usually found at special encounters outdoors, and regenerate themselves after a time. Generally, the person who teaches a recipe tells you what plant it needs."
  3906, "3. The recipe. These are usually bought in towns. You only need to buy each recipe once for the entire party."
  3907, "When you have all these things, go into a town and click on the blue bottle button. Pick the PC with the highest alchemy skill to make the potion. Hope."
  3908, "Here is a list of the alchemical concoctions, with min. skill to make:|Weak Poison|  Min. Skill - 1|Need toadstools or spider glands. The lowest level poison."

  3916, "Resurrection Balm|  Min. Skill - 8|Need ember flowers. Necessary to cast Raise Dead or Resurrection."

  3918, "Strong Healing Potion|  Min. Skill - 10|Need ember flowers. Provides excellent healing."
  3919, "Killer Poison|  Min. Skill - 12|Need asptongue mold. The strongest poison."
  3920, "One of the most useful things you can make with alchemy is poison, a powerful weapon in the magic-poor world of Exile."
  3921, "Many monsters are immune to magic and fire. However, not many are poison-resistant. This makes poison an excellent mage-killer."
  3922, "To poison a weapon, use it during combat. Your hand-to-hand weapon (the first one, if two are equipped) or arrows will become poisoned. Each time you attack, the level of poison decreases."
  3923, "Don't poison a weapon too long before combat. Its effectiveness decreases with time. Also, switching weapons makes the poison disappear."
  3924, "Poisoning an already poisoned weapon doesn't do much good. The weapon gets the maximum poison level of the poison being added or the poison already there, no more."

  7503, "Alchemy can be incredibly useful. Potions can give you the added boost you may need to get through a long grueling dungeon, and you cannot raise the dead without the right concoction."
  7504, "You need three things to make a potion:|1. High alchemy skill. When a character tries to make a potion, his/her alchemy skill must be above a certain level. The higher above that level, the better the chance for success."
  7505, "2. The right ingredient. Ingredients are usually found at special encounters outdoors, and regenerate themselves after a time. Generally, the person who teaches a recipe tells you what plant it needs."
  7506, "3. The recipe. These are usually bought in towns. You only need to buy each recipe once for the entire party."
  7507, "When you have all these things, go into a town and click on the blue bottle button. Pick the PC with the highest alchemy skill to make the potion. Hope."
  7508, "Here is a list of the alchemical concoctions, with min. skill to make: |Weak Curing |  Min. Skill - 1 |Need holly. Cures poison somewhat."
  7509, "Weak Healing |  Min. Skill - 1 |Need comfrey root. Provides mild healing.|"
  7510, "Weak Poison |  Min. Skill - 1 |Need holly or spider glands. The lowest level poison."
  7511, "Weak Speed |  Min. Skill - 3 |Need comfrey root and wormgrass. Hastes drinker."
  7512, "Medium Poison |  Min. Skill - 3 |Need wormgrass or spider glands. A stronger poison."
  7513, "Medium Healing Potion |  Min. Skill - 4 |Need glowing nettle. Quality healing."
  7514, "Strong Curing Potion |  Min. Skill - 5 |Need glowing nettle. A decent antidote for poison."
  7515, "Medium Speed |  Min. Skill - 5 |Need glowing nettle and wormgrass. Hastes drinker a lot."
  7516, "Graymold Salve |  Min. Skill - 7 |Need graymold. Cures disease of all sorts."
  7517, "Weak Energy Potion |  Min. Skill - 9 |Need wormgrass and asptongue mold. Restores some of your spell points."
  7518, "Potion of Clarity |  Min. Skill - 9 |Need graymold and holly. Cures dumbfounding."
  7519, "Strong Poison |  Min. Skill - 10 |Need asptongue mold. Powerful stuff."
  7520, "Strong Healing Potion |  Min. Skill - 12 |Need graymold and comfrey root. Provides excellent healing."
  7521, "Killer Poison |  Min. Skill - 12 |Need mandrake root. The strongest poison."
  7522, "Resurrection Balm |  Min. Skill - 9 |Need ember flowers. Necessary to cast Raise Dead or Resurrection."
  7523, "Medium Power Potion |  Min. Skill - 14 |Need mandrake root and asptongue mold. Restores a fair amount of spell points."
  7524, "Knowledge Brew |  Min. Skill - 19 |This most powerful of potions requires Mandrake and Ember Flowers for its creation."
  7525, "Strength Potion |  Min. Skill - 10 |This brew is a great aid in combat. Making it requires ember flowers and glowing nettle."
  7526, "Bliss |  Min. Skill - 16 |Combining the best elements of healing and strength potions, bliss potions contain asptongue mold and graymold."
  7527, "Strong Energy Potion |  Min. Skill - 20 |This is the hardest potion to make, and require ember flowers and mandrake. The energy boost it provides, however, can't be matched."
  7528, "One of the most useful things you can make with alchemy is poison, a powerful weapon in the magic-poor world of Exile."
  7529, "Many monsters are immune to magic and fire. However, not many are poison-resistant. This makes poison an excellent mage-killer."
  7530, "To poison a weapon, use it during combat. Your hand-to-hand weapon (the first one, if two are equipped) or arrows will become poisoned. Each time you attack, the level of poison decreases."
  7531, "Don't poison a weapon too long before combat. It's effectiveness decreases with time. Also, switching weapons makes the poison disappear."
  7532, "Poisoning an already poisoned weapon doesn't do much good. The weapon gets the maximum poison level of the poison being added or the poison already there, no more."
