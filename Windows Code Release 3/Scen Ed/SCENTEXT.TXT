  Personality 5 ask job: "We have all the things adventurers need. We can give you a room to rest in for the night, for only 5 gold. We have cheap rations available. And, of course, a tankard of beer is only a gold piece."

  Node 1: "That's where you are now."
  Node 2: "I know not what you will find in the lands surrounding Warrior's Grove. You may rest assured, however, that they are filled with adventure, treasure, and direst peril."
  Node 2: "Perhaps you would like some training to help you survive?"
  Node 3: She sighs. "Before I came to Warrior's Grove, I practiced my trade in many cities, both on the surface and in Exile."
  Node 4: "I can hardly remember all the cities I have worked in. All I know is that there wll surely be many more."
  Node 5: Rippel's Fletching
  Node 6: "Adventures. Wars. Hordes of rampaging demons. I've seen it all."
  Node 7: He looks over your items with a practiced eye. It only takes a moment to figure out what each one is. With a smile, he says "No problem. Each identification will be a mere 10 gold."
  Node 8: Walner's potions
  Node 9: "Are you interested in identification or potions?"
  Node 10: He coughs modestly. "Why, my identification skills alone make me invaluable to adventurers."
  Node 11: Marian the Healer
  Node 12: "We priests and priestesses of healing dedicate ourselves to the restoration of those who fall ill, break bones, are gnawed on by monsters, that sort of thing."
  Node 13: "I don't know what's going on outside these walls. However, considering the number of mutilated people that have been coming back lately, it must be something unpleasant."
  Node 14: "We got all sorts of weapons here. You'll need to be well equipped when you leave town."
  Node 15: "There's plenty of monsters out there." He snorts. "Probably too much for the likes of you. But itf you want to have a chance, you want some of my weapons."
  Node 16: Fine Weapons
  Node 17: Fine Armor
  Node 18: Fine Shields
  Node 19: "Weapons, armor, or shields?"
  Node 20: He looks over your surplus goods. "A pretty sorry lot. Still, I might be able to offer you a little for it." He makes an offer for all of your identified items.
  Node 21: "A room, rations, or beer?"
  Node 22: She shows you to your room, and wishes you a pleasant night.
  Node 22: She shakes her head. "Sorry, but that's 5 gold."
  Node 23: Fine Rations
  Node 24: She serves up the beer. It's refreshing, in a nasty sort of way.
  Node 24: She looks pityingly upon you. "Not a gold piece to your name. How sad."
  Node 25: "Yes. Oh, and please bandage your wounds before going to your room. It's a great pain to clean the blood out of the blankets."
